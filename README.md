# GP CALCULATOR

Intro:
This task is aimed at evaluating your understanding of programming with C# language and the fundamental syntax and structures.
Challenge
You are required to write a console application that models a Grade Point Average (GPA) calculator and prints the result.
The result should be displayed in a tabular form as shown below:

Total Course Unit Registered is 21
Total Course Unit Passed is 18
Total Weight Point is 70
Your GPA is = 4.10 to 2 decimal places.

For reference, GPA is calculated as follows: 
GPA = (total weight point) / (total course unit); 
where:
(Weight point) = (course unit) * (grade unit);
 



See grading system below:
Score           	Grade          	Grade Unit      	Remark
70-100         	A                  	5                  	Excellent
